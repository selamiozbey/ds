    * A hash table (also called a hash, hash map, map, unordered map or dictionary) is a data structure that pairs keys
    * to values.

Hash tables:

take on average O(1)O(1) time for insertions and lookups
are unordered (the keys are not guaranteed to stay in the same order)
can use many types of objects as keys (commonly strings)
Hash tables can be thought of as arrays, if you think of array indices as keys!

In fact, hash tables are built on arrays. So if you ever want to use a hash table but know your keys will be sequential
integers (like 1..1001..100), you can probably save time and space by just using an array instead.

Note: hash tables have an average case insertion and lookup cost of O(1)O(1). In industry, we often confuse the average-case
cost with worst case cost, but they're not really the same. Because of hash collisions and rebalancing, a hash table
insertion or lookup can cost as much as O(n)O(n) time in the worst case.
 But usually in industry we assume hashing and resizing algorithms are clever enough that collisions are rare and cheap.
